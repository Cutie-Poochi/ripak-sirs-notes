b) Preparation of soluble salt from insoluble metal carbonate

Q: How can you prepare pure dry magnesium chloride crystals starting from magnesium carbonate?
A: We can prepare pure dry magnesium chloride crystals starting from magnesium carbonate by following the procedures.

Procedures:

1.Some warm dilute hydrochloric acid is taken in a beaker and magnesium chloride is added slowly with constant stirring until no more solid dissolves. Magnesium carbonate reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce magensium chloride, water and carbon dioxide, which escapes from the reaction mixture.
Reaction: MgCO_3(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> MgCl_2(aq) + H_2O(l) + CO_2(g)

2.The reaction mixture is filtered to remove unreacted or excess magnesium carbonate and the filtrate of magnesium chloride collects in a conical flask. The excess magnesium carbonate is trapped by the filter paper as residue.

3.The residue is washed with distilled water to remove all the magnesium chloride from it.
