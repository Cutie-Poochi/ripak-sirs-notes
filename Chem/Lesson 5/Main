\// Didn't do some homework but sir made us do these in class:

1) 
Empirical formula is H_8N_2Cr_2O_7

R.a.m = 8 + 28 + 104 + 112 = 252

252n = 252
n = 1

Molecular formula is H_8N_2Cr_2O_7
Molecular Name is Ammonium dichromate(VI)


MgH_12O_6Cl_2

MgCl_2 * 6H_2O

5)
Empirical formula is MgSH_14O_11

R.a.m = 24+32+14+11*16 = 246

246n = 246
n = 1
Molecular formula is MgSH_14O_11
MgSO_4 * 7H_2O
Molecular name is Hydrated Magnesium Sulfate.
