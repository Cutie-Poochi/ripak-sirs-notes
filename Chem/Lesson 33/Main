Test for Fe^2+ and Fe^3+

For Fe^2+:

1. By using NaOH(aq)

Salt solution is taken in a test tube and 3 drops aqeous sodium hydroxide is added into the test tube. It produces green or dirty green precipitate of Iron(II) hydroxide. But on adding excess aqeous sodium hydroxide solution the precipitate does not dissolve.

Reaction:
FeCl_2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) + 2NaCl(aq)

Fe(NO_3)_2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) + 2NaNO_3(aq)

FeSO_4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) + Na_2SO_4(aq)

Ionic equation:
Fe^2+(aq) + 2OH^-(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) (green)

2. By using NH_3(aq) or NH_4OH(aq)

Salt solution is taken in a test tube and 3 drops aqeous ammonia solution is added into the test tube. It produces green or dirty green precipitate of Iron(II) hydroxide. But on adding excess aqeous sodium hydroxide solution the precipitate does not dissolve.

FeCl_2(aq) + 2NH_4OH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) + 2NH_4Cl(aq)

Fe(OH)_2(aq) + 2NH_4OH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) + 2NH_4NO_3(aq)

FeSO_4(aq) + 2NH_4OH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) + (NH_4)_2SO_4(aq)

Ionic equation:
Fe^2+(aq) + 2OH^-(aq) -> Fe(OH)_2(s) (green)

For Fe^3+:

1. By using NaOH(aq)

Salt solution is taken in a test tube and 3 drops aqeous sodium hydroxide is added into the test tube. It produces brown or red brown precipitate of Iron(III) hydroxide. But on adding excess aqeous ammonia solution the precipitate does not dissolve.

Fe(NO_3)_3(aq) + 3NaOH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_3(s) + 3NaNO_3(aq)
FeCl_3(aq) + 3NaOH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_3(s) + 3NaCl(aq)

Fe_2(SO_4)_3(aq) + 6NaOH(aq) -> 2Fe(OH)_3(s) + 3Na_2SO_4(aq)

Ionic equation:
Fe^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq) -> Fe(OH)_3(s)

2. By using NH_3(aq) or NH_4OH(aq)

Salt solution is taken in a test tube and 3 drops aqeous ammonia solution is added into the test tube. It produces brown or red brown precipitate of Iron(III) hydroxide. But on adding excess aqeous ammonia solution the precipitate does not dissolve.

FeCl_3(aq) + 3NH_4OH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_3(s) + 3NH_4Cl(aq)

Fe(NO_3)_3(aq) + 3NH_4OH(aq) -> Fe(OH)_3(s) + 3NH_4NO_3(aq)

Fe_2(SO_4)_3(aq) + 6NH_4OH(aq) -> 2Fe(OH)_3(s) + 3(NH_4)_2SO_4(aq)

Ionic equation:
Fe^3+(aq) + 3OH^-(aq) -> Fe(OH)_3(s)

Q:What happens when Iron(II) hydroxide is kept in open air?
A:Iron(II) hydroxide reacts with oxygen and water in the air to form Iron(III) hydroxide when it is kept in open air.

4Fe(OH)_2 + 2H_2O + O_2 -> 4Fe(OH)_3
  green                    red-brown
During the reaction green solid turns red-brown.

Q:What happens when Iron(II) hydroxide and Iron(III) hydroxide are heated separatedly in open air?

Iron(II) hydroxide decomposes on heating to produce Iron(III) oxide and water.
Fe(OH)_2 -------> Fe_2O_3 + H_2O
         triangle

Observation: Green colored solution turns brown or red brown.

Iron(III) hydroxide decomposes on heating to produce Iron(III) oxide and water.
Fe(OH)_3 -------> Fe_2O_3 + H_2O
         triangle

Q:How can we obtain iron from Iron(III) oxide?
A:When dry hydrogen gas is passed over heated Iron(III) oxide it produces iron and water.
Reaction:
Fe_2O_3 + 3H_2 -> 2Fe + 3H_20

Q:What happens when dry carbon monoxide gas is passed over heated Iron(III) Oxide?
A:When dry carbon monoxide gas is passed over heated Iron(III) Oxide it produces Iron(III) and carbon dioxide gas.
Reaction:
Fe_2O_3 + 3CO -> 2Fe + 3CO_2
