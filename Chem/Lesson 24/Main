Sulfur can be obtained from underground by a process called Frasch.

Biproduct: A product that is not the main product.

Q:Give 2 sources of sulfur.

A: 1. Frasch Process - By this process we get sulfur from the ground.
   2. Refining of Products - By this process we get sulfur as a biproduct.

Combustion reaction of sulfur:

Sulfur burns in air to produce colourless gas of sulfur dioxide.
   S(s) + O_2(g) -> SO_2(g)

Q:Describe the laboratory preparation of dry sulfur dioxide gas.

A:Principle: We can prepare dry sulfur dioxide gas in the laboratory by the reaction of copper and concenctrated sulfuric acid in presence of heat.
  Reaction:  Cu(s) + conc. 2H_2SO_4(aq) -------> CuSO_4(aq) + 2H_2O(l) + SO_2(g)

Description: Some cupper turnings is taken in the flask and arragned the apparatus as shown in the diagram. Concentrated sulfuric acid is added in to the flash by using tap funnel, then copper reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid in presence of heat to produce copper(II) sulfate, water and sulfur dioxide gas which is passed through the delivery tube.

Drying agent: The produced sulfur dioxide gas is passed through a bottle containing concentrated sulfuric acid which is used to dry sulfur dioxide gas.

Collection: The dry sulfur dioxide gas collected by downward delivery or upward displacement of air as it is heavier than air.

Properties of sulfur dioxide gas.
1. It is a colourless gas
2. It is a pungent or choking smelling gas
3. It is soluble in water
4. It is heavier than air

Chemical test for sulfur dioxide gas:
1. Sulfur dioxide gas turns acidified potassium diochromate(VI) solution from orange to green.
                  or
Test: The gas is passed through acidified potassium dichromate(VI) solution
Result: The solution turns from orange to green.
2. Sulfur dioxide gas turns acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution from purple to colourless.
                  or
Test: The gas is passed through acidified potassium manganate(VII) solution

Result: The solution turns from purple to colourless.

Sulfur dioxide is an acidic gas. It is soluble in water. It reacts with water to form sulfurous acid.
SO_2(g) + H_2O(l) -> H_2SO_3 (aq)

Reaction of sulfur dioxide gas with alkali:
Sulfur dioxide reacts with alkali to produce sulfide salt and water.

SO_2(g) + 2KOH(aq) -> K_2SO_3(aq) + H_2O(l)
NaO_2(g) + 2KOH(aq) -> Na_2SO_3(aq) + H_2O(l)

X + 2HCl(aq) -> Y(g)
