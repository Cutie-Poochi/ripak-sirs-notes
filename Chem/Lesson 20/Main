Hydrogen and its compounds.

Q:Describe the laboratory preparation of hydrogen gas.
A:Principle: We can prepare hydrogen gas in the laboratory by the reaction of zinc with dilute hydrochloric acid.
Reaction: Zn(s)+2HCl(aq) -> ZnCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)
+ Diagram1 +

Description: Some zinc is taken in the flash and arranged the apparatus as shown in the diagram. Dilute hydrochloric acid is added in to the flask by using the tap funnel, then zinc reacts with hydrochloric acid to produce zinc chloride and hydrogen gas which is passed through the delivery tube.

Collection: The produced hydrogen gas collects over water as it is insoluble in water.

Q:Describe the preparation of dry hydrogen gas.
A:Principle: We can prepare hydrogen gas in the laboratory by the reaction of zinc with dilute hydrochloric acid.
Reaction: Zn(s)+2HCl(aq) -> ZnCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)

Drying agent: The produced hydrogen gas is passed through the U-tube containing anhydrous calcium chloride which is used to dry hydrogen gas.

Collection: The dry hydrogen gas collects by upward delivery or downward displacement of air as it lighter than air.


Physical Properties of hydrogen gas:

1.It is a colourless gas.
2.It has no smell (odorless).
3.It is insoluble in water.
4.It is lighter than air.

Chemical test for hydrogen gas.

It makes a pop sound with a lighted splint.
                 or // Meaning you can use any definition for the question
Test:    By using a lighted splint 
Result:  Makes a pop sound
Reaction:2H_2(g)+O_2(g) -> 2H_2O(g)

Test for water.
   CuSO_4(s) + H_2O(l) -> CuSO_4*5H_2O(s)
     white                    blue
   Anhydrous                Hydrated
copper(II) sulfate     coppter(II) sulfate

1.Water turns white colour anhydrous copper(II) sulfate into blue due to the formation of hydrated copper(II) sulfate.

    CoCl_2(s) + 6H_2O(l) -> CoCl_2*6H_2O(s)
      blue                      pink
    Anhydrous                 Hydrated
cobalt(II) chloride      cobalt(II) chloride

2.Water turns blue colour anhydrous cobalt(II) chloride into pink due to the formation of hydrated cobalt(II) chloride.

Q:What happens when hydrogen gas reacts with Cl_2 gas in presence of sunlight?
A:H_2 gas reacts with Cl_2 gas in presence of sunlight(ultraviolet light) to produce hydrogen chloride gas.

                   uv light
H_2(g) + Cl_2(g) ------------> 2HCl(g)

Q:Which gas dissolves in water to form hydrochloric acid?
A:Hydrogen chloride gas dissolved in water to form hydrochloric acid. This gas is very soluble in water.

HCl(g) + H_2O(l) -> HCl(aq)
                 -> H^+(aq) + C^-(aq)
