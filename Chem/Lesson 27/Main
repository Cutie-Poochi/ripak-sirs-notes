Displacement of Ammonia from its Salts

Ammonium salt reacts with strong alkali in presence of heat to produce salt, water and ammonia.

Ca(OH)_2(s) + 2NH_4Cl(s) -> CaCl_2(s) + 2H_2O(l) + 2NH_3(g)
Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and calcium oxide are used widely in agriculture to neutralise excess acidity in soil. However, calcium hydroxide has one undesirable effect when used in soil treatment. Calcium hydroxide fertiliser reacts with Ammonium chloride to form ammonia gas, which then escapes into the atmosphere. This causes the loss of nitrogen from the fertilisers already added in the soil by farmers.

Halogens
Group-7 elements are known as halogens. They have seven electrons in the outermost shell. They exist as diatomic molecules. (F_2, Cl_2, Br_2, I_2)

Element	chlorine	bromine	iodine
Colour		green		red/red-brown	black/grey
Physical state	gas		liquid		solid

Q: State two ways in which the physical properties of halogens change as the group is descended.
Cl_2
Br_2
I_2
A:
1. Down the group state changes to be more solid.
2. Down the group color becomes darker.

Q: Describe the laboratory preparation of dry chlorine gas.
A:
Principle: We can prepare dry chlorine gas in the laboratory by the reaction of manganese(IV) oxide and concentrated hydrochloric acid in presence of heat.
Reaction: MnO_2(s) + Conc. 4HCl(aq) ------------>  MnCl_2(aq) + 2H_2O(l) + Cl_2(g)
