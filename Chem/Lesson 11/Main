\// I probably missed a class here considering there's no explanation of chromotagraphy, my dumbass self didn't make another lecture folder tho.

Q:Experiment:
	To separate the colored dye in black ink using paper chromatography.

A: + Diagram1 +
We can separate the colored dyes from the black ink by paper chromatography.

Procedure:

  i) Draw a pencil line on a piece of chromatography paper about 2cm from the end of the paper.

 ii) Put a tiny spot of black ink on the pencil line by using capillary tube. Allow the spot to dry. Repeat by dropping the ink two or three times on the same spot.

iii) Suspend the chromatography paper inside a glass tank containing a small volume of ethanol. Ensure that the ink spot is about 1cm above the level of ethanol, which acts as a solvent in this experiment.

 iv) Observe the solvent front carefully as it travels up the paper. Remove the piece of chromatography paper when the solvent front reaches nearly to the top of the paper. Allow the paper to dry.

Observation: The colored spots are left in the different places on the paper at the end of the experiment.

Result: The chromatogram shows that the ink is a mixture of three dyes.

Q:How do you analyse a mixture of colorless amino acids using paper chromatography?

A:The mixture of amino acids is spotted on the chromatography paper and left in contact with the solvent used in the experiment. Before the solvent reaches the top of the paper, the experiment is stopped and paper dried. A locating agent is then sprayed on the paper. The locating agent reacts with amino acids to form colored spots on the paper. This enables the different amino acids to be identified easily.

Q:What is Rf value?

A: + Diagram2 +
It is the ratio of distance travelled by the substance or dye to the distance travelled by solvent, it is constant. The differnet substances or dyes have different Rf values in the same solvent.
