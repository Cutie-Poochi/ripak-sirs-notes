Periodic table: It is a list of elements arranged in order of their increasing proton atomic numbers. The Periodic table divides the elements into periods and groups.

Periods: Horizontal rows of elements in the periodic table are known as periods. The total number of electron shells indicates the period number.

Groups: Vertical columns of elements in the periodic table are known as groups. The total number of electrons in the outermostshell of an element indicates the group number.

Ion: An ion is a charged particle. It is charged because it contains an unequal number of protons and electrons. A neutral atom becomes an ion by losing or gaining electron(s).

Cation (positive ion): A cation contains more number of protons than electrons. An atom becomes a positive ion by losing electron(s).

Anion (negative ion): An anion contains more number of electrons than protons. An atom becomes a negative ion by gaining electron(s).

Q: Give the formula of each of six different ions which have same electron configuration as neon.

A: N^3-, O^2-, F^-, Na^+, Mg^2+, Al^3+

Q: Give the formula of the atom which has the same electron configuration as Ca^2+ or S^2-

A: Ca^2+ = S^2- = Ar = 2,8,8

Metallic and Non-metallic Characterisitcs

Metals are grouped on the left-hand side of each period and non-metals are grouped on the right-hand side of each period.

** Across the period from the left to right metallic properties decrease and non-metallic properties increase. Across the period from left to right atomic radius decreases (size of atoms).

** Down the group metallic properties increase and non-metallic properties decrease. Down the group the atomic radius increases (size of the atoms).

Q: Explain why across a period from left to right size of atom (atomic radius) decreases?

A: Across a period from left to right number of protons (effect nuclear charge) increases but outer electrons are in the same shell so force of attraction between nucleus and outer shell electrons increases thus size of the atoms decreases.

Q: Explain why down the group the size of the atoms increases?

A: Down the group shell number increases and distance between the nucleus and outer shell electrons also increases. So forces of attraction between the nucleus and outer shell electrons decrease. Thus size of atoms increases.
