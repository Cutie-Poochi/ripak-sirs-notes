Description: Some manganese(IV) oxide is taken in a round-bottomed flask and the apparatus is arranged as shown in the diagram. Concentrated hydrochloric acid is added into the flask by using the tap funnel and the mixture is heated. Then concentrated hydrochloric acid and manganese(IV) oxide react together in presence of heat to produce manganese(II) chloride, water and chlorine gas with certain amount of hydrogen chloride gas, which is passed through the delivery tube. The gas mixture is passed through a bottle containing water to remove hydrogen chloride gas as it is very soluble in water but chlorine gas is slightly soluble in water.
Drying agent: They hydrogen-chloride-gas-free chlorine gas is passed through another bottle containing concentrated sulfuric acid which is used to dry the chlorine gas.
Collection: The dry chlorine gas collects by downward delivery or upward displacement of air as it is heavier than air.

Physicial properties of chlorine gas:
1. It is a green colored gas.
2. It has irritating smell.
3. It is slightly soluble in water.
4. It is heavier than air.

Chemical test for chlorine gas:
Chlorine gas rapidly bleaches the moist litmus paper(blue/red)
Test: By using moist litmus paper.
Result: Rapidly bleaches the litmus paper.

Cl_2(aq) --> colourless
Br_2(aq) --> orange/yellow
 I_2(aq) --> red-brown/brown

Q: How is reactivity affected down the group of halogens:
A: Down the group reactivity of halogens decreases. Down the group atoms get larger in size. Distance between nucleus and outer shell increases. As a result, force of attraction between nucleus and outer shell decreases. There is less attraction for the gaining of extra electron.

A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive halogen from a halide solution of the less reactive halogen.

Q: What happens when chlorine gas reacts with aqueous solution of sodium iodide?
A: Chlorine gas reacts with aqueous solution of Sodium iodide to produce sodium chloride and iodine because chlorine is more reactive than iodine.

Cl_2(aq) + 2NaI(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + I_2(s)

// If they say then iodine can be aqueous: Cl_2(aq) + 2NaI(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + I_2(aq)

Observation: 1) The solution turns red-brown or brown colour.
             2) Black solid or iodine deposited

Q: Why is I_2 aqueous in the reaction?
A: // I'm confused about this answer
Chlorine water reacts with sodium iodide to produce sodium chloride and iodine because Cl_2 is more reactive than I_2.
Cl_2(aq) + 2NaI(aq) -> 2NaCl(aq) + I_2(aq)
Observation: The colourless solution turns brown or red-brown.

Q:Describe the laboratory preparation of dry hydrogen chloride gas.
A: + Diagram1 +
Principle: We can prepare dry hydrogen chloride gas in the laboratory by the reaction of concentrated sulfuric acid and sodium chloride.
Reaction: NaCl(s) + H_2SO_4(l) -> HCl(g) + NaHSO_4(s)

Apparatus: Tap funnel and flask

Chemical test for hydrochloric acid:
HCl(g) + NH_3(g) -> NH_4Cl(g)
Hydrogen chloride gas makes white dense fumes of ammonium chloride with ammonia gas.
or
Test: By using ammonia gas.
Result: It makes white dense fumes.

Q: What happens when chlorine gas is passed over heated iron?
A: Chlorine gas reacts with iron in heat to produce iron(III) chloride.
2Fe(s) + 3Cl_2(g) -> 2FeCl_3(s)

Q: How do you produce iron(II) chloride?
A: Dry HCl gas is passed over heated iron to produce iron(II) chloride and H_2 gas.
Fe(s) + 2HCl(g) ----> FeCl_2(s) + H_2(g)
