Q: Describe a test to show that sulfuric acid is a strong acid.
A: Sulfuric acid solution is taken into a beaker and a universal indicator is added into the beaker. It shows a red colour thus the sulfuric acid is a strong acid.

Q: Describe a test to show that sulfamic acid (H_3NSO_3) is a weak acid.
A: Sulfamic acid solution is taken into a beaker and a universal indicator is added into the beaker. It shows a yellow colour thus the sulfamic acid is a weak acid.

Q: Describe a test to show that Potassium hydroxide is a strong alkaline.
A: Potassium hydroxide solution is taken into a beaker and a universal indicator is added into the beaker. It shows a purple colour thus the Potassium hydroxide is a strong alkaline.

The pH meter: The pH of a solution can also be measured by using an electrical meter called the pH meter. This method is more accurate than using Universal Indicator. By the pH meter we can measure the pH of a solution in two decimal places.

Properties of Acid:
1. An acid solution turns blue litmus paper into red due to the presence of H_3O^+(aq)/H^+(aq)
2. Acid reacts with base to produce salt and water.
CuO(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) -> CuSO_4(aq) + H_2O(l)
2NaOH(aq) + H_2SO_4(aq) -> Ma_2SO_4(aq) + 2H_2O(l)
3. Acid reacts with metal carbonate and metalhydrogen carbonate to produce salt, water and carbon dioxide gas.
MgCO_3(s) + 2HCl (aq) -> MgCl_2(aq) + H_2O(l) + CO_2(g)
2NaHCO_3(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) -> Na_2SO_4(aq) + H_2O(l) + CO_2(g)
4. Metal which is more reactive than hydrogen reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid and dilute sulfuric acid (but not with nitic acid) to produce salt and hydrogen gas.
Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> MgCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)
Zn(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) -> ZnSO_4(aq) + H_2(g)

Iron reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid or dilute sulfuric acid to produce Iron(II) salt.
Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> FeCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)
Fe(s) + H_2SO_4(aq) -> FeSO_4(aq) + H_2(g)
