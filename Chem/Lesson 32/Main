Copper chemistry

Test for Cu^2+ ion:

(i). With NaOH(aq):
Cu^2+ solution is taken in a test tube and 3 drops aqeous sodium hydroxide solution is added to the test tube.
It produces blue precipitate but on adding excess aqeous sodium hydroxide blue precipitate does not dissolve.

CuSO_4(aq) + 2NaOH(aq)
           v
Cu(OH)_2(s) + NaOH(aq)
 Blue ppt.

Cu(NO_3)_2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq)
           v
Cu(OH)_2(s) + 2NaNO_3(aq)
 Blue ppt.

CuCl_2(aq) + 2NaOH(aq)
           v
Cu(OH)_2(s) + 2NaCl(aq)
 Blue ppt.

Ionic equation
Copper(II) hydroxide precipitate.
Cu^2+(aq) + 2OH^-(aq)
       |
       v
   Cu(OH)_2(s)

(ii). With aqueous NH_3
Copper salt solution is taken in a test tube and 3 drops aqeous ammonia is added into the test tube. It produces blue precipitate.
CuSO_4(aq) + 2NH_4OH(aq)
         |
         v
Cu(OH)_2(s) + (NH_4)_2SO_4(aq)

Cu(NO_3)_2(aq) + 2NH_4OH(aq)
         |
         v
Cu(OH)_2(s) + 2NH_4NO_3(aq)

CuCl_2(aq) + 2NH_4OH(aq)
         |
         v
Cu(OH)_2(s) + 2NH_4Cl(aq)

Ionic equation
Copper(II) hydroxide precipitate.
Cu^2+(aq) + 2OH^-(aq)
       |
       v
   Cu(OH)_2(s)

But on adding excess aqeous ammonia the blue precipitate dissolves to give deep blue solution due to the presence of complex copper ions.

Q: What happens when copper(II) carbonate is heated?
A: Copper(II) carbonate decomposes on heating to produce copper(II) oxide and carbon dioxide.

CuCO_3(s) -------> CuO(s) + CO_2(g)
          triangle

Observation:
Green colored solid turns black.

Q: What happens when copper(II) hydroxide is heated?
A: Copper(II) hydroxide decomposes on heating to produce copper(II) oxide and water.

Cu(OH)_2(s) -------> CuO(s) + H_2O(g)
            triangle

Observation:
Blue colored solid turns black.

Q: What happens when solid copper(II) nitrate is heated?
A: Solid copper(II) nitrate decomposes on heating to produce copper(II) oxide + nitrogen dioxide gas + oxygen gas.

2Cu(NO_3)_2(s) -------> 2CuO(s) + 4NO_2(g) + O_2(g)
               triangle

Observation:
Blue colored solid turns black. Brown colored gas is formed.

Q:How can you get copper from copper(II) oxide?

A:When dry hydrogen gas or carbon monoxide gas is passed through a heated copper(II) oxide to produce water or carbon dioxide gas.

CuO(s) + H_2(g) -------> Cu(s) + H_2O(g)
                triangle
CuO(s) + CO(g) -------> Cu(s) + CO_2(g)
               triangle

Iron chemistry:

Some colored compounds of iron
Fe(OH)_2 --> green
Fe(OH)_3 --> brown or red brown
FeSO_4 * 7H_2O --> green
Fe_2O_3 ---> brown or red brown

Fe^2+ contained in salt solution is green or pale green in color.
Fe^3+ contained in salt solution is orange, brown or red brown in color.

Q: What happens when freshly prepared iron(II) salt solution is kept in open air?

A: When freshly prepared iron(II) salt solution is kept in open air it gets oxidized, that is green or pale green solution turns orange or brown.

Q: What happens when iron reacts with dilute hydrochloric and dilute sulphuric acid?

A: Iron reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce
iron (ii) chloride and hydrogen gas.
Fe(s) + 2HCl(aq) -> FeCl_2(aq) + H_2(g)

Iron reacts with dilute sulphuric acid to produce iron (ii) sulphate and hydrogen gas.
Fe(s) + 2H_2SO_4(aq) -> 2FeSO_4(aq) + 2H_2(g)

Observation:
Effervescence is seen
Solution turns green or pale green.
