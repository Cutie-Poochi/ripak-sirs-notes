Sublimation
When a solid directly becomes a gas without first becoming a liquid on heating, this process is called sublimation. Sublimation occurs because the particles at the surface have enough energy to break off from the solid and escape as a gas. The vapour of the sublimable substance is called sublimate. Iodine, ammonium chloride, dry ice (solid CO_2), etc.

By sublimation we can separate a sublimable substance from a mixture of non-sublimable and a sublimable substance.


Ammonium chloride is in the mixture of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride.

Q: How can you separate ammonium chloride from the mixture of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride?

A: + Diagram1 + 
At first the mixture is placed in an evaporating dish with an inverted glass funnel which is over the top as shown as in the figure and the mixture is heated gently then the ammonium chloride changes into gas and cools back to solid on the glass funnel. The sodium chloride remains in the evaporating dish.

Q: Write the soluble and insoluble salts in water.

A: 1. All nitrates salts are soluble in water.
   2. All chloride salts are soluble in water except AgCl and PbCl_2 but PbCl_2 is soluble in hot water.
   3. All sulfate salts are soluble in water except CaSO_4, SrSO_4, BaSO_4, PbSO_4 and Ag_2SO_4 but CaSO_4 and Ag_2SO_4 sparingly soluble in water.
   4. All carbonate salts are insoluble in water except (NH_4)_2CO_3, Na_2CO_3 and K_2CO_3.
   5. All salts of Na and K are soluble in water. 

// Whenever you pronouce Pb in PbCl_2 or PbSO_4 say 'lead (II)'

Precipitation Reaction
Two solutions mix together to form an insoluble solid. This is known as precipitation reaction.
Example: Pb(NO_3)_2 (aq) + Na_2SO_4 (aq) -> PbSO_4(s) +  2NaNO_3 (aq)

Filtration: It is a process by which an insoluble solid substance can be separated from an insoluble solid in liquid mixture with the help of filter paper. Filtration has two parts which are:-

Residue: The insoluble solid part of the mixture which can't pass through the filter paper and traps on the filter paper is called residue.
Filtrate: The liquid part of the mixture, which passes through the filter paper is called filtrate.

By the filtration we can separate insoluble solid/precipitate from the mixture.


Q: How can we separate sodium chloride (soluble salt) from the mixture of sodium chloride and sand (insoluble solid)?
A: + Diagram2 + Diagram3 +
We can separate soldium chlroide from the mixture by following procedures.
Procedures:
1. The mixture is taken in a beaker and distilled water is added into the beaker, with constant stirring until all the sodium chloride is dissolved in water.
2. The mixture is poured into a filter funnel lined with filter paper and the filtrate of sodium chloride solution is collecteed in conical flask. But the sand is trapped on the filter paper as residue.
3. The residue is washed with distilled water to remove all sodium chloride from it.
4. The filtrate is taken in an evaporating dish and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness. The white solid left in the evaporating dish is sodium chloride.

Q: How would you obtain pure lead(II) sulfate from a reaction mixture containing aqueous sodium sulfate and lead(II) nitrate solution?
A: + Diagram4 + Diagram5 +
We can separate lead(II) sulfate from the reaction mixture by following procedures.
Procedures:
1. Some aqueous solution of lead(II) nitrate is taken in a beaker and aqueous sodium sulfate solution is added into the beaker. Then the mixture is stirred with a glass rod.
2. The reaction mixture is poured into a filter funnel lined with filter paper and the filtrate is collecteed in conical flask but the insoluble lead(II) sulfate traps on the filter paper as residue.
3. The residue of lead(II) sulfate is washed with distilled water to remove any soluble impurities.
4. The lead(II) sulfate is allowed to dry on a piece of filter paper.
