The molecular formula of aluminium sulfate is Al_2(SO_4)_3

Q: Calculate the relative formula mass of Al_2(SO_4)_3.
A: The relative formula mass of Al_2(SO_4)_3 is
= 27*2 + (32+16*4)*3
= 54+96+192
= 342

Q: Calculate the percentage by mass of each element of Al_2(SO_4)_3
A: % of Al =  54/342 * 100% = 15.79%
   % of S  =  96/342 * 100% = 28.07%
   % of O  = 192/342 * 100% = 56.14%

The formula of hydrated sodium sulfate is Na_2SO_4 * 10H_2O
Q:Calculate the relative formula mass of Na_2SO_4 * 10H_2O
A: The relative formula mass of Na_2SO_4 * 10H_2O is
= 23*2 + 32 + 16*4 + 10(1*2+16)
= 46 + 32 + 64 + 20 + 160
= 322

Q: Calculate the percentage by mass of each element of Na_2SO_4 * 10H_2O
A: % of Na =  46/322 * 100% = 14.29%
   % of S  =  32/342 * 100% =  6.52%
   % of O  = 224/342 * 100% = 69.57%
   % of H  =  20/342 * 100% =  6.21%

Q: Calculate the percentage by mass of water.
A: % of H_2O = (10(1*2+16))/322 * 100%
   = 180/322 * 100% = 55.9%

Empirical formula: It is the formula which shows the simples whole number ratio of the atoms of different elements present in one molecule of a compound.

Molecular formula: It is the formula which shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in one molecule of a compound.

The relation between empirical formula and molecular formula is
Molecular formula = (Empirical formula)n where n = 1,2,3,4 ... a whole number.

Q: An organic compound conatins C -> 38.7%, H -> 9.7%, O -> 56.6% and relative formula mass is 62. Calculate empirical and molecular formula.
A: C:H:O = 37.7/12 : 9.7/1 : 51.6/16
         =       1 :     3 :       1
So, empirical formula is CH_3O

(CH_3O)n = 62
=> (16+1*3_16)n = 62
=>          31n = 62
So,           n = 2
So, molecular formula is (CH_3O)2 or C_2H_6O_2.

Q: An oxide of iron contains 705 iron by mass, Calculate the impirical formula of this iron oxide.
A: Fe:O = 70/56 : 30/16
        =  1.25 : 1.825
        =     1 : 1.5
        =     2 :   3
So, empirical formula is Fe_2O_3
