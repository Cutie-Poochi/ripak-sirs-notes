Group 2

Group 2 elements are known as alkaline earth metals.
They have 2 electrons in the outermost shell.
Their reactivity increases down the group.

Reaction of group 2 elements with oxygen:

2M(S) + O_2(g) -> 2MO(S)
2Mg(s) + O_2(g) -> 2MgO(s)
2Ca(s) + O_2(g) -> 2CaO(s)

They react with water to form hydroxides and hydrogen gas.
Calcium reacts with cold water by sinking to form calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas.
Ca(s) + 2H_2O(l) -> Ca(OH)_2(aq/s) + H_2(g)
Observation: The solution turns cloudy, effervescence is seen

Reactions with halogens:
Group 2 metals react with halogen to produce metal hallides.

M + X_2 -> MX_2
Mg(s) + F_2(g) -> MgF_2(s)
Ca(s) + Cl_2(g) -> CaCl_2(s)

Describe the thermal reactivity of group 2 metal carbonates.
Group 2 metal carbonates decompose on heating to produce metal oxides and carbon dioxide gas.
MgCO_3(s) -> MgO(s) + CO_2(g)
CaCO_3(s) -> CaO(s) + CO_2(g)
SrCO_3(s) -> SrO(s) + CO_2(g)
BaCO_3(s) -> BaO(s) + CO_2(g)
Group 2 metal carbonates are thermally unstable.
Thermal stability increases down the group as the reactivity of the metal decreases.
Barium carbonate decomposes at a higher temperature than calcium carbonate.
Thermal stability of group 2 metal nitrates.
Group 2 metal nitrates decompose on heating to produce metal oxide in nitrogen dioxide gas and oxygen gas.

2Ca(NO_3)_2(s) -> 2CaO(s) + 4NO_2(g) + O_2(g)
Group 2 metal nitrates are thermally unstable.
