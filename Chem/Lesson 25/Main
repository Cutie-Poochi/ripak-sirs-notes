Nitrogen and its compounds

1. Nitrogen is a group (V) element.
2. It is a gas at room temperature and pressure.
3. It is chemically inactive or inert because it has strong triple bonds between the nitrogen atoms.

Reaction of Nitrogen and Oxygen in the atmosphere

Nitogen gas reacts with oxygen gas during thunderstorm when lightning occurs to form a colourless gas of nitrogen monoxide.

N_2(g) + O_2(g) -> 2NO(g)

The produced nitrogen monoxide gas reacts with oxygen in the air to form a brown coloured gas of nitrogen dioxide.

2NO(g) + O_2(g) -> 2NO_2(g)

Then nitrogen dioxide gas reacts with water and oxygen in the air to form a colourless liquid of nitric acid.

4NO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l) + O_2(g) -> 4HNO_3(aq)

Physical properties of nitrogen gas

1. It is a colourless gas.
2. It has no smell.
3. It is almost insoluble in water.
4. It is slightly lighter than air.
