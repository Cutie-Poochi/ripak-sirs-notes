Q: Finding the percentage of O_2 by volume in air.
  a) By using the bell jar method

A: A piece of magnesium ribbon is burnt in air under a bell jar. The changes in the height of the water in the water is shown in the following diagrams. + Diagram1 +

1. The water level falls at the start of the experiment because the heat of the flame causes the air to expand.

2. At the end of the experiment the water level rises about 1/5th or 20% of the bell jar because the oxygen in the air has been used up.

3. Some magnesium ribbon remains in the dish. This shows that the magnesium was in excess.
