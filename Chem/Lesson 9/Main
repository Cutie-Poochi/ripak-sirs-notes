Evaporation to dryness: Solid salt may be recovered from salt solution by evaporation until all of the water has boiled away. This is called evaporating to dryness.

By this process we can get anhydrous salt.

Crystallisation: When a solid dissolves in a liquid solvent, a solution is produced. If this solution is heated, some of the solvent evaporates. When a hot solution is allowed to cool, some of the dissolved solid reappears as pure crystals. This is called crystallisation.

By the crystallisation we can separate a soluble salt from a salt solution. If the salt contains water in its crystal then we get hydrated salt or crystal with water. Slower the cooling larger the crystal size and fast the cooling smaller the crystal size.

Q: How can we separate pure dry crystals of copper(II) sulfate (soluble salt) from the mixture of copper(II) sulfate and sand (insoluble solid)?

A: + Diagram1 + Diagram2 + Diagram3 +
We can separate copper(II) sulfate crystals from the mixture by the following procedures:

Procedures

1. The mixture is taken in a beaker and distilled water is added into the beaker, with constant stirring, until all the copper(II) sulfate is dissolved in the water.

2. The mixture is poured into a filter funnel lined with filter paper and filtrate of copper(II) sulfate solution is collected in a conical flask. But the sand is trapped on the filter paper as residue.

3. The residue is washed with distilled water to remove all the copper(II) sulfate from it.

4. The filtrate of copper(II) sulfate solution is taken in evaporating dish and heated to crystallisation point.

5. The hot solution is allowed to cool and after some time copper(II) sulfate crystals will start to appear.

6. The crystals are separated by filtration.

7. The crystals are allowed to dry.

Miscible liquids: When two liquids mix together completely to form a single solution, they are said to be miscible liquids.

Immiscible liquids: // I probably had a powercut cuz no more notes here
