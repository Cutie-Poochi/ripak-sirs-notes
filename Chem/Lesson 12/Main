Acid, Base and Salt.

Acid: An acid is a substance which produces hydrogen ions (H^+) when it is dissolved in water.

HCl (aq), HNO_3 (aq), H_2SO_4 (aq), H_2SO_3 (aq), H_3PO_4 (aq), H_2CO_3 (aq), CH_3COOH (aq), etc. There are two types of acid which are weak and strong acid.

Weak acid: Acid which is partially dissociated (ionised) in aqueous solution is known as weak acid. For example H_2CO_3 (aq), CH_3COOH (aq), etc.

CH_3COOH(aq) -> H^+ (aq) + CH_3COO- (aq)
             <-
Strong acid: Acid which is completely dissociated (ionised) in aqueous solution is known as strong acid. For example HCl (aq), HNO_3 (aq), H_2SO_4 (aq), etc.

HNO_3 (aq) -> H^+(aq) + NO_3^-(aq)

Acids:

HCl      (aq) -> Hydrochloric acid
HNO_3    (aq) -> Nictic Acid
H_2SO_4  (aq) -> Sulfuric Acid
H_2SO_3  (aq) -> Sulfurous Acid
H_3PO_4  (aq) -> Phosphoric Acid
H_2CO_3  (aq) -> Carbonic Acid
CH_3COOH (aq) -> Ethanoic Acid.

Solubility of metal hyrdroxide and oxide in water:
1. Group 1 metal hydroxide and oxide are soluble in water.
2. The solubility of Group 2 metal hydroxide and oxides increases down the group. For example: Barium Hydroxide is more soluble than Magnesium Hydroxide.
3. Except Group 1 and 2 other metal oxides and hydroxides are insoluble in water.

Base: Metallic oxide and hydroxide are known as base. For example Na_2O, NaOH, K_2O, KOH, CuO, Cu(OH)_2, MgO, Mg(OH)_2, NH_4OH, etc.

Alkalis: The bases that are soluble in water and produces hydroxide ions in aqueous solution are known as alkalis. For example: KOH, NaOH, Ba(OH)_2, Ca(OH)_2, Mg(OH)_2, NH_4OH, etc.

There are two types of alkalis which are strong alkali and weak alkali.
Strong alkali: Alkali which is completely ionised in water is known as strong alkali. For example: KOH, NaOH, Ba(OH)_2, etc.

KOH(aq) -> K^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)

Weak alkali: Alkali which is partially ionised in water is known as weak alkali. For example Mg(OH)_2, NH_4OH, etc

NH_4OH(aq) ->
           <- NH_4^+(aq) + OH^- (aq)


All alkalis are bases but not all bases are alkalis.

Salts: A salt is a compound obtained when the hydrogen of an acid is partly or completely replaced by a metal ion or an ammonium ion. For example NaCl, NaHSO_4, Na_2SO_4, K_2CO_3, K_2CO_3, etc.

There are two types of salts which are acid salt and normal salt.

Acid salt: It is obtained when the hydrogen of an acid is partly replaced by a metal ion or an ammonium ion. For example NaHSO_4, KHCO_3, KHSO_4, NaHCO_3, etc.

Normal salt: It is obtained when the hydrogen of an acid is completely replaced by a metal ion or an ammonium ion. For example NaCl, NH_3Cl, Na_2SO_4, K_2CO_3, etc.

The pH scale

1. An acid solution has a pH value 0 to less than 7. Smaller the pH value the stronger the acid.

For example two solutions X and Y have pH values 4 and 2. So Y is stronger acidic solution than X.

2. An alkaline solution has a pH value greater than 7 to 14. Greater the pH value the stronger the alkali. For example two solutions C and D hav pH values 12 and 10. So C is stronger alkali solution than D.

3. A neutral solution has a pH value exactly 7.

Indicator: An Indiciator is a compound that has one colour in acid solution and another colour in alkaline solutions.
