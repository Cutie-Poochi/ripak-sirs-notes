Laboratory preparation of dry ammonium gas:

Principle: We can prepare dry ammonia gas in the laboratory by the reaction of calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) and ammonium chloride in presence of heat.
Reaction:   Ca(OH)_2(s) + 2NH_4Cl(s) -> CaCl_2(s) + 2H_2O(l) + 2NH_3(g)
+ Diagram1 +

Description: A solid mixture of calcium hydroxide and ammonium chloride is taken in the flask and arranged the apparatus as shown in diagram. The mixture is heated, then calcium hydroxide and ammonium chloride react together to form calcium chloride, water and ammonia gas which is passed through the delivery tube.
Drying agent: The common drying agents such as concentrated sulfuric acid can not be used to dry ammonia gas because ammonia gas reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid. The produced ammonia gas is passed through a container packed with calcium oxide to dry ammonia gas.
Collection: The dry ammonia gas collects by upward delivery or downward displacement of air as it is lighter than air.

Q: Explain why concentrated sulfuric acid is not used to dry ammonia gas.

A: 1 mark- It reacts with ammonia gas.
   2 mark- Ammonia gas reacts with concentrated concentrated sulfuric acid to form ammonium sulfate. Reaction:
   2NH_2+H_2SO_4 -> (NH_4)_2SO_4
   So we don't use sulfuric acid.
  
** Ammonia gas is very soluble in water. It reacts with water to form ammonium hydroxide and the produced solution contains OH^- ions. So the solution turns red litmus paper into blue. Ammonia is an alkaline gas.

Physical properties of Ammonia gas.
1. It is a colorless gas.
2. It has a pungent or choking smell.
3. It is very soluble in water.
4. It is lighter than air

Chemical tests for Ammonia gas.

1. Ammonia gas turns moist red litmus paper into blue.
Test: We use moist red litmus paper in the gas.
Result: It turns the paper blue.
2. Ammonia gas makes white dense funes with hydrogen chloride gas.
 HCl(g) + NH_3(g) -> NH_4Cl(g)
Test: By using hydrogen chloride gas
Result: Makes white dense fumes.

Q: What happens when dry ammonia gas is passed over heated copper(II) oxide.
A: Dry ammonia gas reacts with heated copper(II) oxide to produce copper,  water and nitrogen gas. Reaction:
2NH_3(g) + 3CuO(s) ------->  3Cu(s) + 3H_2O(g) + N_2(g)
            ^^     triangle    ^
        black solid       pink or red brown
By the reaction black colored solid turns pink or red brown.

Copper doesn't react to form hydrogen gas.

Properties of Copper:
1. Copper does not react with dilute and concentrated hydrochloric acid

Cu + dil * HCl -> no reaction
Cu + Conc * HCl -> no reaction

2. Copper does not react with dilute sulfuric acid.

Cu + dil * H_2SO_4 -> no reaction

3. Copper reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid.
+ Diagram2 +

4. Copper reacts with both dilute and concentrated nitric acid.

+ Diagram3 +

Copper reacts with dilute nitric acid to produce copper nitrate, water and colorless nitrogen monoxide. 

With Conc. HNO_3(aq)

+ Diagram4 +

Copper reacts with concentrated nitric acid to produce copper nitrate, water and brown color of nitrogen dioxide gas.
