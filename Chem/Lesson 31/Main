Reaction of some metals with steam:
Magnesium reacts with steam in case of heat to produce magnesium oxide and hydrogen gas.
Mg(s) + H_2O(g) = MgO(s) + H_2(g)

Zinc reacts with steam in case of heat to produce zinc oxide and hydrogen gas.
Zn(s) + H_2O(g) = ZnO(s) + H_2(g)

Iron reacts with steam in case of heat to produce Triiron tetraoxide and hydrogen gas.
3Fe(s) + 4H_2O(g) = Fe_3O_4(s) + 4H_2(g)

Transition metals:

The first set: Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu

Differences between transition metals and non transition metals:
Transition metals have variable charge.
Transition metals have higher melting points.

Properties of transition metals:
1. They have variable oxidation states.
Fe - +2, +3
Cu - +1, +2
Mn - +2, +4, +7
2. They form colored compounds
CuSO_4 * 5H_2O(s) - blue
FeSO_4 * 7H_2O(s) - green
3. They form complex ions.
[Cu(NH_3)_4(H_2O)_2]^2+ - deep blue
[Fe(CN)_6]^3-
4. Transition metals and their compounds are used as catalysts.
Iron metal is used for the production of ammonia gas through the Haber process.
                 Fe
N_2(g) + 3H_2(g) _> 2NH_3(g)
                 <-
V_2O_5 is used as catalyst for production of Sulphur trixode (SO_3) in the contact process
                 V_2O_5
2SO_2(g) + O_2(g)  _> 2SO_3(g)
                   <-
5. They have high melting and boiling points.
6. They are hard.
7. They have high density.
